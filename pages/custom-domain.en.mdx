title: Custom Domain
---

- By default, Vercel give you a subdomain with your project name like - [adlink.vercel.app](https://adlink.vercel.app) or [adlink.netlify.app](https://adlink.netlify.app). But you can add your own domain. 
Vercel/Netlify give you option to add any domain to the deployed project like [agcrisbp.my.id](https://agcrisbp.my.id). All you have to do is follow Official [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/domains/add-a-domain) or [Netlify Documentation](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/20/how-to-add-custom-domains-to-netlify-sites/).
